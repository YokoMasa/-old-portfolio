        <p>
            There are so many beautiful places in Japan that are not necesarily famous.<br>
            I made this website to introduce those places to people who want to travel to Japan. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike articles written by someone who have never visited the place before, <br>
            (and I don't like the fact that those kind of articles are usually well SEOed and come up at the top of the search engine...)<br>
            places I introduce are all actually visited ones.

        <p>
            When we want to eat ramen, first thing we will do is to search "ramen" on Google or GoogleMaps.<br>
            The internet shows us so many choices, and we choose one ramen restaurant from several points of view: price, distance, rating...<br>
            That's a good thing about information society.
        </p>
        <P>
            But sometimes we are tired of processing lots of information.<br>
            This website will tell you a random ramen restaurant near you, so you can just go there without thinking anything.<br>
            You might be able to find a great ramen restaurant where you wouldn't have visited if you compared with other restaurants on the internet!
